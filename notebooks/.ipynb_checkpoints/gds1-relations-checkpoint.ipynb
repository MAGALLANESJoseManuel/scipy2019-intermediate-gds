The convex hull is like the polygon you'd get if you took a rubber band and stretched it around the most extreme points. Every point is inside of the convex hull, but some points will be on its boundary. Further, the shape is *convex*, meaning that the straight line between any two points will also be contained within the convex hull. We can build convex hulls from a group of points using the `unary_union` attribute of a `GeoSeries` (to collect them together into a single geometry), and then using the `convex_hull` method for that shape.
